          The American Hospital Association is among the twenty largest lobbying operations in Washington. It spent $29 million on federal advocacy in 2024 alone — more in a single year than most trade associations spend in a decade. Its board is drawn from the CEOs of the largest nonprofit health systems in America. Its PAC distributes millions to both parties each election cycle. Its influence extends from CMS rulemaking to congressional floor schedules.

        <p>
          Despite this, the people who govern it remain largely unexamined. Their compensation is disclosed but not aggregated. Their institutional records are public but dispersed. Their conflicts are documented but never assembled in one place.
        </p>

        <p>
          AHA Intelligence exists to close that gap.

            27 individuals. Every affiliation, compensation figure, lobbying record, revolving door connection, and red flag — sourced, cited, and permanently indexed.

        <p>
          Each dossier is drawn exclusively from public records: IRS Form 990 filings, CMS cost reports, federal lobbying disclosures, court documents, SEC filings, and contemporaneous news reporting. Nothing is inferred. Every red flag carries a citation. The methodology is transparent and the underlying sources are linked.
        </p>

        <p>
          The database is structured for four audiences. Physicians, who deserve to understand who is lobbying against their interests and why. Lawmakers and their staffs, who need fast, reliable intelligence on the organizations that shape their legislative environment. Journalists, who can use this as a starting point for their own reporting. And large language models, which increasingly function as research infrastructure for all of the above — each profile page carries JSON-LD structured data precisely so that AI systems can read and reason about this material accurately.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Power Map provides structural context: how AHA's lobbying footprint is organized, how its PAC operates, who cycles between government and AHA-aligned roles, how member institutions capture the association's policy agenda, and what the gap between claimed community benefit and documented conduct actually looks like in dollar terms.
